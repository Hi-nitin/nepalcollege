            "Chairman Message": "Dear parents and students,\nThousands of students drain out from Nepal in search of quality education to India and other countries every year. There are Nepalese who have the capacity to run high quality educational institutions in Nepal itself. Therefore, it has become futile for students to go abroad with a view to attaining quality education. Padmashree offers international quality education at an affordable cost. Proper development of both head and heart leads an individual towards sustainable fast growth in career and life. For that, every student needs an environment conducive to self-learning with team work, nurturing and guidance by experienced mentors and teachers. Recognizing this fact, we have designed and launched many innovative activity-oriented student-centered talent development programs for our students to ensure their wholehearted involvement. In fact, many of our activities and events are initiated and managed by the students themselves. This enriches the students' team work abilities and project management skills that are crucial for success in their career. At Padmashree, students get an opportunity to learn to respond to newer challenges, identify and seize opportunities and discover their own talents through trust and partnership in learning. Come, join Padmashree and grow with us. Thank you!",

            "Chairman Message": "Dear Students, Parents, Faculties, and Staff,\nPublic Youth Campus (PYC), synonymous with Nepal’s commerce education, was established in 2028 B.S. (1971 A.D.) by amalgamating the Public Commerce College and Nepal Youth College. It is a constituent unitary management campus of Tribhuvan University. The campus currently offers various undergraduate (BBS, BTTM, BBA, and BBM) and graduate programs (MBS, MBM, and MTTM) of management and is dedicated to producing skillful managers and entrepreneurs for the betterment of the country. It is a decentralized campus directed by its own independent management committee and governed by its executive committee. The campus is situated in Chhetrapati, Dhobichaur, the historical and typical urban area of Kathmandu Metropolitan City, adjacent to the nation’s tourism hub, Thamel. It operates in a spacious area with ample sports facilities and sound infrastructure.\nPYC is pleased with its accomplishments. It emphasizes a robust educational experience that is molded by self-control, dedication, zeal, insights, curiosity, and inventiveness that can withstand the rigors of the modern world. Lectures, group discussions, presentations, field trips, personality development, and other life skills for professional advancement are all included in our teaching and learning modules. We encourage our students to enroll in demanding courses so they can gain the required knowledge and skills to compete in the global market. We are dedicated to offering 21st-century management education that is goal-oriented, practical, and grounded in values, as well as the best human resources available. We not only hope but have also demonstrated that students who successfully complete their academic program on our campus will be qualified to take on significant responsibilities on a national and international level and will have excellent standing. With the cooperation of national and international institutions, our future direction is to provide more vibrant and enriching teaching, learning, and research environments as well as state-of-the-art infrastructure, well-equipped computer laboratories, and a business incubation center that stimulates entrepreneurship and innovation.\nThe campus is further envisioned to offer fully digitalized, 21st-century-friendly educational services to students and believes in incorporating research findings into making the learning process more effective. As a result of the efforts of our strong research department, we have been constantly publishing a research journal named PYC Journal of Management (a two-star rating journal). We have developed a supportive and collegial community that aims to nurture the educational, personal, social, and cultural growth of students.\nFinally, I would like to express sincere gratitude to all of the campus founders, professors, staff, free student union, students, and other stakeholders for their diligent efforts and precious time in the development of the campus. It might be intimidating to start something new, but it can also be incredibly exhilarating, and it is my immense pleasure and privilege to work as a team leader with you all. I hope the coming days of the campus will be exciting, stimulating, enjoyable, and life-enhancing by attracting thousands of diverse youngsters throughout the country, thereby preventing the drain of billions of national resources flying out from the country.\nI look forward to welcoming you to Public Youth Campus.",

            "About Us": "International Internship\nAs a component of the DT program, the students are currently placed in different organizations across India to gain practical experience. They are working on a web development and Meta-verse project to learn hands-on skills and techniques.\nJob Placement Cell\nThe Job Placement Cell (JPC) at PGS works to establish corporate relationships with reputable businesses in Nepal to provide internship and job opportunities for graduates. The JPC believes that practical experience gained through internship programs and experiential learning is essential for producing successful business leaders and innovators. The department is dedicated to finding the best career opportunities for PGS graduates who possess international degrees and unmatched competence. The department has partnerships with respected media and corporate entities in Nepal to facilitate placement and internship opportunities. \nGuest Speakers Session\nAt PGS, they recognize the significance of the diverse backgrounds and experiences that individuals bring to the table. They believe that the life and work experiences of these individuals can serve as valuable lessons for the students. To that end, they extend invitations to personalities from a variety of fields to share their experiences and engage with our students.\nECA / CCA\nPresidential not only prioritizes academics but also encourages extra-curricular activities to enhance students' personalities. The institution provides platforms for students to showcase their talents through cultural and sports events like Sports Week, PGS Gala, and Holi. These events are managed by student-led clubs, promoting bonding and improving social and emotional intelligence. PGS students also embody the spirit of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) through their involvement in humanitarian efforts like blood donation drives, cleaning campaigns, walkathons, and documentaries on World Environment Day.\nWorkshop / Training\nRegular workshops and training sessions are held to bridge the gap between theoretical education and the practical corporate skills necessary for success in related fields. These sessions are conducted by experts from various fields, who provide valuable insights and expertise in a conducive environment to transfer life lessons and enhance skills.\nToastmasters Club\nToastmasters International is a non-profit organization that has been teaching public speaking and leadership skills through its worldwide network of clubs since 1924. With over 15,800 clubs spread across 149 countries, the organization boasts a membership exceeding 300,000 individuals. Toastmasters International has helped individuals from diverse backgrounds become more confident speakers, communicators, and leaders. In 2021, the Presidential Toastmasters Club (AREA 2, DIVISION A, DISTRICT 41) was established with the aim of promoting communication and leadership skills among students. The club provides a life-changing opportunity for students to improve their skills and enhance their personal and professional growth.\nWriting Center\nTo acknowledge the significance of English language skills in academic and professional life, PBS has established the PGS Writing Center, which is fully equipped to provide additional guidance and support to students in need.

In addition, the center provides tutorials on oral communications, which can be of great value for students preparing for speeches or oral presentations that may be relevant to their future professional lives.",
            "Chairman Message": "I would like to take this opportunity to welcome you all to Presidential Business School. I am proud to be part of this college and hope that you also share in the same sentiment once you are part of the PBS family. PBS has a very stimulating, vibrant environment, which is but a result of a heterogeneous make-up of students from a wide variety of backgrounds with a singular pursuit of rewarding international BBA/ MBA degrees. Always supportive and friendly, we do embrace the fact that each student is a unique individual and that such distinctiveness has to be preserved. Yet, paradoxically or not, our attempt has always been to override any inward-looking individuality for a more liberal, inclusive society. No wonder we are, therefore, also holistic in our approach to teaching and learning, the student welfare always being our first priority.\nIn fact, Presidential Business School—a fully integrated global management school and model center for business/ management studies in Nepal—is founded with a goal to offer unparalleled educational service, and the right orientation to the aspirant BBA/ MBA entrants. The goal seems evidently reachable with our team of expert faculty members and educationists who have behind them a long experience of having catered to the needs of the students vying for the degrees that are on a par with the international ones. And, with Westcliff University’s BBA and MBA degrees here in Nepal, the job seems already half-done!\nI must also note in passing that at the crucial stage of choosing careers, especially in this era of cut-throat competition at a global level, students often find themselves confused. Yet, bright careers await those who dare to dream, act upon their dreams and focus on their goals with unflagging determination and dedication. These students will also, upon completion of their course, witness their chances of employment increase considerably—and globally too! We have a flexible approach designed to suit both your personal and professional commitments. Besides, our pioneering work-based learning programs make it possible for your academic work to be combined with your chosen career. This flexibility is vital for studying at the Graduate Level in particular. We are confident that the programs outlined in this prospectus provide a sound, quality-assured learning experience in the field of management studies.\nOnce again, I keenly look forward to welcoming you here at PBS.",

            "Chairman Message": "\"For men may come and men may go, But I go on forever\"\nHow true Lord Tennyson was when he spoke about the brook. When I reflect on these lines, I feel the same applies to KCMIT also. Students have come and gone, but KCMIT stands tall, radiating the warmth to all the family members of the past and present and waiting eagerly to usher the new.\nFor more than a decade we have moved along steadily and left an imperishable imprint in the history of education, not only as the pioneer college of the BIM Program and a firm up-coming college of the BBA Program, but also in grooming young ladies and gentlemen to face different challenges of the 21st century. Our growth has definitely not been flamboyant, but mature and dignified as year after year, our students have proved themselves in all walks of life – be it higher studies or the job market – KCMITians have carved their way through in this world of cut-throat competition. When success stories of our alumni are heard, a sense of gratifying joy envelopes the reigning atmosphere. These laurels which we cherish today are the outcome of the endless effort of the entire college family- the management, faculty, the administrative staff, the domestic staff and the students themselves. Each one has endeavored to elate the position of KCMIT in the education map; surely this is an accomplishment of the team spirit prevalent amongst the college community. Though we have established ourselves as an abode of learning and an institution which cares for the ethical, professional and social growth of the youth, who have taken shelter under our wings, we still have to go a long way to reach the goal we have set before us. Prior to sending out BIM and BBA graduates into the big, wide, world we want to send good human beings who will uplift themselves above all petty bickerings and spread the message of love and understanding to one and all.\nMay the Almighty Lord help us in our march towards our goal and lead us from darkness to light.",

            "Chairman Message": "We call this, the original sanskara: to make oneself best of the best in the society in terms of knowledge, purity, love, happiness, peace, bliss and power.\nIt gives me great pleasure in introducing K&K International College as a leading academic institution of Nepal, with a very strong commitment for quality education.\nOur Vision: We believe in Swami Vivekananda’s vision on education. In his words, “education is manifestation within”. The meaning of his words, as far as I understand, is about achieving the seven qualities which used to be in the human beings of the golden age of human civilization. We call this as the original sanskara: to make oneself best of the best in the society in terms of knowledge, purity, love, happiness, peace, bliss and power. These words have deep-rooted meanings and it will definitely take a long, long time to achieve this vision. An arduous strive and hard work is essential to make this dream come true, and this is the dream of K&K; the dream of K&K team. However, one ought to be mindful that Knowledge without Wisdom is more or less like a driver without control. Such a situation is prone to a disastrous ending. Hence, at K&K we ensure and instill wisdom into our students to ascertain that a boost of knowledge does not drive them into an uncontrollable frenzy. Our mission: The present mission of K&K is quite explicit; it has always been striving to the best of its capacity to make the students able to plan for their future, participate in all the sectors in building their career and lead the mass in order to achieve peace, development and prosperity for all.\nOur Strength: K&K’s strength is by virtue of the presence of dedicated, senior most, professional academicians, whose tireless and assiduous efforts have made it possible to scale the present height of this institution. In addition, the subjects offered are affiliated to Tribhuvan University, which is recognized by most Universities of the World. Therefore, in this respect, we are world class education provider. Besides courses prescribed by the University, we compulsorily provide needful computer courses to the students of all faculties. Moreover, we believe in the fact that education is not complete without extracurricular activities like workshops, seminars, educational tours , quiz contests and sports. Thus, we always plan for these events in the beginning of the academic session and implement them subsequently. Dear guardians, students, and all well wishers, we look forward to welcome you at K&K in the new premises of about six ropanies with sufficient ground for sports, spacious library wel-stocked with sufficient reference materials, hygenic and well maintained canteen, comfortable seminar hall, and class rooms with the best environment for academic excellence.",

            "About Us": "Why Choose National College?\nUnique courses in South Asia\nNational College established in 1996 is a pioneer institution in South Asia offering under-graduate studies in development fields. \nKathmandu University Affiliation\nThe college has been associated with Kathmandu University, one of the best university for higher learning since 1996. It is the only college offering courses on development affiliated to Kathmandu University. \nInternational Students Exchange Program\nNepal Japan Students Exchange Program, a joint initiative between National College, Waseda University and University of Sacred Heart, Tokyo, Japan has been in practice since 2006. From the year 2017, Sophia University, Tokyo too has become a partner in this program. \nThrough Confucius Institute in Kathmandu University (CIKU), 17 National College students so far got an opportunity to visit China for education, learning and cultural exchange.\nNational College and Paul Smith’s College (PSC) of USA have initiated joint field studies in Nepal under which 6 National College students visited the USA and 14 US students visited Nepal for field studies, learning and cultural exchange.\nGlobal Internship Opportunities\nStudents of National College have been provided with internship opportunities to organizations in Bangladesh, India, Thailand, and Philippines. \nField Studies\nStudents of National College visit various organizations, cultural heritage and historical sites all over Nepal for first hand practical learning experience. \nResearch Grants\nIn the past two years (2018 and 19) 48 research grants and financial assistance have been provided to students undertaking independent research activities on the basis of outstanding research proposals.",
            "Chairman Message": "Dear Students, \nWe believe that the purpose of education is to teach our students to think and develop a capacity to reason out facts. Students should be able to keep in mind the importance of planning and proper utilization of their time, which are essential to achieve success.Academic programs will be most productive when the curricular activities are well supported with research and practical activities. Similarly, the courses should be dynamic as well as contextual. Based on the notion of Research, Innovation and Entrepreneurship, National College has been offering three different innovative academic programs in association with Kathmandu University.\nDuring the studies, students have been able to produce and bring wide range of opportunities for further research, entrepreneurship and economic development through regular research works, project works, workshops, trainings and seminars. In today's world with limited resources, the development challenges are very stiff. Traditional resources, conventional thinking and old technology will not be able to meet the challenges. We should explore new resources, come up with new and innovative ideas, modernize technology and explore new approaches to boost up the economic development. You have to take inspiration from the graduates of National College, who have achieved remarkable and outstanding success. But it is ultimately the perspiration that is hard work, determination and dedication  along with innovative  thinking  that will lead to success. The future belongs to you.",

Access to the internet has been more affordable than ever before. As a result, various sectors are reaping advantage of this with the possibility  of exponential growth in the near future.\nSoftwarica College of IT and E-Commerce commenced in the year 2010 with a vision to provide globally recognized education complementing with practical skills to Nepali students for them to be able to compete in the global landscape. Up until recently, we are exporting unskilled labour but I believe we should be able to export products and services powered by technology in the coming decade. For this, we need to invest in human capital to be able to produce knowledge workers and this is where Softwarica plays a key role in the private sector. I am confident that this initiative will be supported and complemented by the government too.\nI welcome all prospective students to join our college and learn the latest industry focused IT curriculum to build your strong career with an advantage of a British Degree globally recognized by employers around the world which you will carry along through your life time.",

            "About Us": "Major Highlights Of The College\n\nNIET was awarded with the Best private College in Nepal from the Ministry of Education on the occasion of 37th National Education Day-2073 and international literacy day.\nThis is the only affiliated college in Nepal, the first among Purbanchal University colleges and the first Engineering College in Kathmandu valley to receive QAA-Institutional Accreditation Certificate from the University Grant Commission (UGC), Nepal.\nThe college has successfully organized two International Conferences on \"Medical Materials, Devices and Regenerative Medicine (MMDRM)\"  and one international seminar on “Recent Developments in Biomedical Engineering” in Kathmandu where Professors, scientists, engineers, clinicians and researchers from different countries all over the world, including USA, UK, Australia, Japan, Belgium, China, Singapore, India and Nepal participated and presented papers.\nAbove 40% of our graduates are pursuing Masters and PhD programs in reputed Universities around the globe. More than 40 of them have already completed their Ph.D. Most of the graduates of this college have received full scholarships, assistantships or research grants for their higher studies. Some of them have also received prestigious scholarships such as Erasmus Mundus (Europe), Marie Curie fellowship (Italy) and Singa Award (Singapore).\nSome of the NIET graduates have established their own companies and have provided jobs to many biomedical engineers.\nSince its inception in the year 2062, we have already produced 13 (Thirteen) batches with above 500 graduates and to the best of our knowledge none of the graduates are found to be unemployed.\nOur students have received first prizes in paper and poster presentations at various national and international conferences. Many articles written by our students have already been published and are being published in international journals like Photodiagnosis & Photodynamic Therapy, Engineering Reports, Dalton Transactions, International Journal of Biomedical & Advance Research, Journal of Engineering in Medicine, International Journal of Creative & Innovative Research in all Studies and many more.\nWe have been providing internships to foreign students and some of our students are also going to foreign countries for the same reason. We have already established partnership with International Association for the Exchange of students for Technical Experience (IAESTE) for this purpose.\nStudent's intake quota has been increased from 72 to 96 from the last year.",
            "Chairman Message": "Dear students, guardians and well-wishers!\nWhen I glance back at a decade an half that we have passed and think about the achievements, we have sufficient reasons to take pride and satisfy ourselves on our achievements and are in the continuous process of achieving more.\nThe questions that we had to face in those fifteen years were:\n\nWhat is the future of the students after graduating from this college?\nCan we go abroad for higher studies?\nWhat is the future of biomedical engineers in Nepal?\n\nNow, the scenario has completely changed and there is only one question being asked frequently:  \"Can we get admission easily in this college?\" Due to the overwhelming flow of the students, we have raised the seats from 60 to 96.\nSince the graduation of our first batch of students in the year 2009, more than 40% graduates from this college have gone abroad for higher studies. They are admitted not only in Master's course but also directly into PhD. Most of them have already completed their studies and started working.\nOur students are studying almost all over the world including USA, UK, Canada, Ireland, Germany, Belgium, Finland, Switzerland, Netherlands, Australia, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, China and India. Most of them have received research and teaching assistantships as well as prestigious scholarships like Erasmus Mundus and Singa awards. Those who have stayed back in Nepal are all engaged, some of them having established their own companies giving employment to other graduates.\nWe are concentrating not only on academic field, but on research and overall development of the students. Our students have come out with some outstanding and very useful research projects and publications.\nIn short, look at our achievements that we have accomplished during those years:\nWe have already organized three international conferences. We are the recipient of QAA (Certificate of Institutional Accreditation) from University Grants Commission (UGC-Nepal) as well as Best Private Engineering College Award from the Ministry of Education, Nepal Government. We are very likely to launch Master's degree program in Biomedical Engineering in this college from the next academic year.\nTo conclude, I must extend my sincere thanks from the core of my heart to those teachers and administrative staffs for contributing from their side in overall development of this college.\nThank you!",

By every measure, the institute has created its own league, hence, our students have poised to become a national & international leader in their respective field.\nSince 2004, we are moving ahead, dedicated to our mission, providing pathways to thousands of students in becoming a certified leader. Our comprehensive program blazes an extraordinary trail. Students enrolled in our courses are made to brainstorm, form tools and strategies they might require in the existing market. The courses are planned out in more structural form so that the students are aware of the practical and theoretical knowledge.\nI still see a vision, to perceive many possibilities, and with the NCA team, we shall continue to notch it every year.\nThank you.",

            "About Us": "Beyond The Text That Sets Our Benchmark\nINSPIRATION FOR INNOVATION-\nStudents are expected to explore modes to navigate rewarding ideas that inspire them in their professional careers. \nLEARNING FOR ATTITUDE \nThe degree of positivity within the graduates would determine their career prosperity. Students are prepared with techniques and strategies for enhancing positive attitudes and perceptions.  \nEXPERIENTIAL LEARNING\nDAV graduates undertake filed research, live projects, as well as they, go through the internship, field trips, excursion in order to materialize their classroom knowledge into the working atmosphere. During this process, a team of experts and respected faculties facilitate the students so that they can learn pragmatically and enhance their aptitude.  \nMIND MAPPING APPROACH\nThe practical approach facilitates our students to unleash their creativity. This approach has been expected to enhance the critical and creative thinking of the students.\nRESEARCH AND PLACEMENT CELL\nThe Cell organizes several research-based programs to generate new issues and findings to question and stimulate the intellectual milieu in the campus. Similarly, the Cell, with college collaborators, has been a bridge to find opportunities for our students in various firms. \nINCUBATION AND MANAGEMENT LAB\nDAV college inculcates the applied ideas required for corporate houses and business entrepreneurs in collaboration with the reputed firms and the professionals. Student’s regular interaction and visits to the respective firms familiarize corporate proceedings. The objective is to link student’s creativity with the corporate culture thereby enabling them to confront any of the possible business challenges and opportunities that may come in the future. \nNAVIGATION OF CASE ANALYSIS AND DEVELOPMENT\nDAV realizes that the experience to materialize the project into case studies development is just another hoop to jump through. This project has the potential to enhance students learning experience in several important ways: creative thinking, critical thinking, information literacy, inquiry and analysis, integrative learning, problem-solving, and written comprehension. \nMENTORSHIP\nD.A.V. has been operating its mentorship programs through faculty members, senior students, D.A.V. Alumni, business, and entrepreneur collaborators to contribute to student’s professional development. \nPARTICIPATORY LEARNING\nThe college has opted for the mechanism of empowering its’ students through various student-initiated programs via four major student clubs such as media and publicity, publication, sports and event management, and social welfare. \nRESEARCH JOURNALS\nDAV College publishes a peer-reviewed DAV Research Journal where our students are encouraged to write research papers and get published. The interdisciplinary journal accommodates articles from management, humanities, and social sciences. \nNATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE\nD.A.V.

The first international conference, \"Integrating Knowledge and Technology for Sustainable Development\" was held on March 24-25, 2018. The conference hosted seventy research paper presentations from scholars of ten different countries. We have printed and online access to all the research articles presented during the conference. The next conference has been scheduled for 2021 A.D.\nPROFESSIONAL ASSIGNMENT (PA), COMPREHENSIVE LEARNING ASSIGNMENT (CLA)\nThe thrust of the practical approach of learning through research assignment is the key additive to the knowledge development of our students.\nAnnual Vlog Fest\nThe D.A.V. Vlog Contest has been designed to fortify the creativity of its students. This outside the box perspective intensifies the hidden skill of the students on top of their interpersonal skills.",
            "Chairman Message": "Dear Students,\n\"Education is the most important weapon which you can use to change the world\" -Nelson Mandela\nI firmly believe that one of the most important ages in our life is the prime of youth which we all invest in education, and such a crucial moment obviously raises expectations about the multiple forms of returns during the rest of our lives. Here, I would like to say that just as the selection of a right field of study for future career is a great challenge, so is the choice of a college for professional degrees like BBA, BBM, BBS and MBS.\nBusiness Management is about more than what we assume as a comfortable corporate office the big swivel chairs and a handsome salary and the accompanying perk; it is all about understanding the delicate balance that exists among people, raw material, information, technology, market force and national law. The courses, thus, must take into account these factors. Additionally, there must be a spotlight on the grooming of the students' total personality so that they may become confident, acceptable and effective leaders in the globalized business environment.\nD.A.V.'s vision is to produce such manpower which can provide assertive leadership. Our mission is to understand and anticipate the needs of the corporate community, The TU curriculum offered here at D.A.V. along with non-credit courses and programs like personality development, communication skill, on-the-job training, case study, business tour and presentation skill development helps turn out the desired kind of manpower.\nIf the goal is to climb up the corporate ladder, to start your own business, to improve your managerial skills, to make a business career or to pursue higher studies in Management, then D.A.V. College is the right place to go to. The conferring of the National Business Schools Rating-Ranking-Awards for the Best Undergraduate B-School (2014, 2017, 2018 & 2019 A.D.) on D.A.V. and the placement of the college's graduates in enviable positions bolster my statement.\nOn this upbeat note, I wish the forthcoming students a time of great achievements at D.A.V. The college, I assure, leaves no stone unturned in putting in cent percent effort in unraveling and maximizing the potential of its students.",

            "Chairman Message": "I feel honored to have this opportunity to welcome students, teachers, and administrative staff of Padma Kanya Campus, the only constituent Campus of the Tribhuvan University established over six decades ago for imparting higher education to women. Additionally, I express my gratefulness to students who have trusted this campus as a destination for their learning. \nHigher education for women in the world was not common until 1889 as they were limited to household work. Women were allowed to study at Oxford University but they were not granted a degree until ..... Modern, formal education for Girls began in India during the British Colonial period. Traditional education under the Gurukul was, however, part of ancient Hindu culture. If we think of the history of the university in modern terms, Bologna was the oldest university in the world. South Asian history of university started with Takshyashila and Nalanda Universities some 2500 years ago. Unfortunately, South Asia could not continue its scholarly traditions owing to political upheavals in the region. Yet education has been considered to be the foundation of human humility, righteousness, wealth, right action and happiness in the South Asian tradition and thinking as expressed in this stanza:\nBidhya dadati Binayam binayat yati patratam\r\npatratwo dhan mapnoti dhanat dharma tata sukham\nPadma Kanya Campus has been established by the founders with the pious aim of imparting higher education to women to ensure their happiness as empowered citizens. The Campus which started with just a few Intermediate and Bachelor level programs in the humanities has expanded its academic horizon over the years. Currently, it runs Bachelor and Master level programs under the faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, Management, and Science and Technology. It has been gradually adding up programs of like Bachelor of Business Administration, Bachelor of Computer  Application and Bachelor of Hotel Management with a view to cater to the growing vocational needs of the students. This Campus has played a significant role in women's empowerment through higher education. \nThe graduates of this Campus have pioneered social, cultural, educational and political interventions in the country. I recall it with pride that many girls who graduated from this Campus now hold leadership positions in diverse avenues of society at the national and international levels. \nI appreciate the unrelenting support and courage received from national and international well-wishers like the Government of Denmark, Government of Japan, and the United Arab Emirates. Finally, as the Campus Chief, I express gratitude to the former and current students for choosing this college as their alma mater, and for their contribution and devotion to make this institution an elegant venue of learning.\nSignificant Changes are taking place in the campus at present. The campus has got autonomy to run its academic programs. It is working towards gaining accreditation from the University Grants Commission. Following the privileges of autonomous status, the Campus is in a position to designing a few new courses and run them independently. We are trying to envision cutting-edge academic programs capable of meeting the complex academic and societal needs. For materializing the dream of making PKMC a competitive academic institution of Nepal, I honestly urge the concerned students, faculty, staff and guardians that our mutual effort will change the face of this institution and produce female human resources capable to meet the growing global challenges of the time through their learning of pure and applied sciences. It is worth noting at this moment that education alone can build and save human societies from threats and challenges. Furthermore, women's education has greater consequences because they are the game changers at home and the workplace. Therefore, I humbly request to all stakeholders to help this institution from the possible quarters so that we are able to produce bold, critical, visionary and creative women who will lead our society.\nPKMC is centrally located at the heart of Kathmandu city. In terms of physical infrastructure and other amenities, it can efficiently run academic programs that require moderate facilities. It does have qualified faculty strength and sufficient educational resources. I feel that we still need to fix our academic calendar with the extreme amount of particularity; we need to revisit our pedagogy by diversifying it towards critical interactive methodologies where students do have greater opportunities to learn by doing; we need to make the faculty and the administrative staff more committed and responsible to their duty, and we need to divert students' attention from political sloganeering and indulgence to diligent educational practices demanding their devotion to learning. It's time that we start from self-improvement and if we do so, we can change the face of PKMC for the better. With humility, I request the students, faculty and administrative staff for their support and urge them to remain committed to the welfare, further upliftment and progress of PKMC. I am sure that our efforts shall certainly yield and we will continue producing fully empowered women.",

            "About Us": "DUAL FACULTY SYSTEM\nThis is a unique teaching mechanism that KFA pioneered in Nepal in a highly structured manner. Under DFS, two Resource Persons – the Academic Professors (APS) & the Professional Contributors (PCs) teach each and every subject.\nEVOLVE SERIES\nEvolve Series includes a series of structured classes that help students learn, develop and polish their skills. Communication, Writing, Computing, and Etiquettes are some of the many skills that students master from these classes.\nCAREER CELL\nSince 2010, KFA has placed over 500 students in various reputed companies inside and outside the country. KFA has a well-laid-out systematic process of meeting students’ career aspirations and corporate expectations. Here, the Career Cell functions as a bridge between the College, Industries, and Students.\nSTUDENT PROFILING AND CAREER MAPPING\nAs soon as a student enrolls at KFA, profiling is done to identify students based on traits, characteristics, and/or behavior and most importantly their strength. Student profiling is a process of collecting facts, insights, and analysis of their skills. This is led by Career Cell with a distinctive skill mapping technique to help them realize their strength.\nENTREPRENEURSHIP BRAINSTORMING SESSION\nAt KFA, we privilege students to take their business ideas forward through Entrepreneurship Brainstorming Session. The envisioned ideas are put through a process of feasibility check. In this session, students are encouraged to freely put their business ideas discussed in the panel. Once the ideas are checked for feasibility, they then are put into action in the next process.\nBUSINESS ENTERPRISE MANAGEMENT PROJECT\nBEMP is a comprehensive Business Project undertaken in the ‘Entrepreneurship’ subject during the Second Year. Under BEMP students will actually register a real firm/company (although with a very low capital) as per their interest area and they perform real business activities, including Legal, Finance, Operations & Marketing. In short, through BEMP, students will be ‘Business-Ready’. \nPROFESSIONAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP GROUP\nThis is an initiative taken by KFA to create entrepreneurship in the country. Once students are ‘Business-Ready’ through various subjects that they learn in the MBA Program and also upon successful completion of BEMP, they are ready for PEG.\nINDUSTRY BASED RESEARCH\nA need assessment is undertaken in different industries to assess the gap in the organization. Students will be supervised by their respective mentors in association with the host organization. Students will work on the research topic and spend time working at the host organization.\nDELIVERING REAL CONSULTING ASSIGNMENTS\nThe benefit of having prior experience in real working cases always befits the possibility to get the job you want. Under this pillar, students are assigned to do a real consulting assignment after a gap analysis in a relevant industry. The project is led by the students in groups and is assigned a supervisor.\nGLOBAL ECONOMIC ANALYSIS\nKnowledge ranging from Economic to political to social and cultural helps to grow confidence in individuals. Global Economic Analysis is a comprehensive session on current global economic topics. This is a continuous program where generally a guest speaker, who is an expert in the topic, presents an informative session backed by reliable data.\nBUSINESS OBSERVATION TOUR\nDomestic\nBusiness Observation Tour (domestic) is a one-day program where students explore the operating cycle of a service/manufacturing/ trading company. The visit is made in the nearby company (inside valley) for the ease of learning.\nInternational\nThose students enrolled in Day MBA are also taken outside the country to visit the International facilities as a part of their course learning whereby they get exposure to international systems and processes.\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\nKFA has a dedicated Research Department under the guidance of the Academic Department which facilitates research-based learning and knowledge building within the organization. The students are engaged in primary and secondary research which is an integral part of their Compulsory Research-Based Assignments for every subject in each semester.",

            "Chairman Message": "Dear Xavierians!\nAs we explore, reflect, and assimilate the theme of the year- interconnectedness, allow me to call your attention to a grave crisis that has deepened during the COVID-19 pandemic. Perhaps this story might help us to understand the theme of the year better.\nOnce, Mr. Moron was sailing with a group. As they sailed on he began to carve a hole on the boat to entertain himself with water gushing high like a fountain through the small hole he carved. The co-sailors were shocked to see his insanity and asked why he was being so reckless, endangering the lives of all. They asked him if he knew that the boat would slowly sink. Moron snubbed them saying, “it’s a small hole after all and it’s on my spot. What does it matter to you”?It matters because all of us on this planet are co-travelers in the same boat. Undiscerned actions of one person or a country affect all the co-travelers on this planet. The spread of the coronavirus, climate change in the world, displacement due to war are to name a few.\nOn the other hand, the goodness of humanity does not seem to spread as fast and vast as the evil in this global village. A recent report of WHO estimates that almost 690 million people went hungry in 2019 which is 10 million higher than in 2018. Needless to mention the current pandemic has added many more to the existing figure. It is loud and clear that hunger is a pressing humanitarian crisis today and as Xavierians, this cannot escape our eyes!\nThe first step to understanding the heaviness of hunger at the core level of a person is to feel the pain of the hungry. Take time to listen to their stories and witness the reality of their life. Then we may be moved to do the little we can to feed the hungry in our own surroundings. As St. Xavier’s College family let us begin with baby steps in addressing hunger around us!\nI urge all Xavierians, alumni, parents, and friends of SXC to do all that we can as individuals and as groups to reach out to the hungry! Miss no chance to feed a hungry person and to be compassionate! Let no food ever be wasted!",

We are committed to make the educational experience for each of our students satisfying, fulfilling, and fun to transform the pursuit of knowledge and quest for one's career building into success.\nAs the current infrastructures of the Campus are felt inadequate for the students, it was necessary for the campus to construct its own building. So as to provide the needed classroom space and create an improved environment for teaching and learning, the Campus had decided to construct a building for a long time. The day was dream come true with its Foundation Stone Laying Ceremony of KMC, at Jadibuti on June 11, 2016. Ambassador of India H.E. Ranjit Ray laid the foundation stone on the hundreds gathered auspicious ceremony. Thus, our journey from strength to stability has truly been established.

            "About Us": "Our Team\nOur academic team is among the most seasoned, with nearly every member having more than ten years of experience in the field of engineering education.\nCommitment to Excellence\nFaculty and students work on some of the most significant educational projects and engineering research of our time in cutting-edge labs and research centers, fostering crucial research and technology transfer. The achievement of our professors and students demonstrates the College's dedication to excellence.\nTraining and Placement Unit\nThe specialized Training and Placement Unit at Sagarmatha makes certain that our graduates have the professional skills necessary to participate in the professional sector.\nHuman approach\nOur staff and faculty members are aware of the issues that young people today are facing, and they assist our students in focusing their energy to realize their goals. We do our best to provide the personal connection that strengthens our pupils and recognize that everyone of our students has unique ambitions that the developed world will recognize and value.\nProject-driven approach\nAt least a million engineers graduate from every conceivable stream each year. But only a small number of them are able to apply their expertise to create a valuable thing—a fix for one of our issues. We thus ensure that each student studies only with the goal of resolving the current challenge. It may be something straightforward or something groundbreaking. But once more, this can't be used to compare two kids. Instead, the student must meet requirements that require them to take action to address a real-world issue.\nLearning Environment\nLectures, seminars, and private tutorials serve as the foundation for teaching and learning, with an emphasis on helping students acquire information and skills that they can use in the real world and develop the ability to discern what is right and wrong in terms of morality and professional ethics. We foster an atmosphere where every one of us may learn and have a positive impact on the world at large.\nBeyond Academics\nWe have faith that by working together, we can both enhance our own lives and the world. Aside from academics, there are a lot of other things. The fundamental components, together with sports and leisure, are what make up the ideal recipe for an outstanding existence. Innovation and creativity are also important.",
            "Chairman Message": "Education enables a person to face new challenges, achieve progress and lead a successful life. We, therefore, at Sagarmatha Engineering College, would like to encourage all students to thrive for the best to make them knowledgeable in their relevant branches of engineering with high self-esteem and discipline. Education at our Institution is not only for academic brilliance but also for an ambience where our ancient cultural heritage and human skills are enhanced.\nWhile Sagarmatha has enjoyed growth and expansion over the years, it remains dedicated to its original mission: “To impart world class education and produce internationally competent Engineers with enterprising spirit.” This college provides a lively environment for learning and discovery through latest teaching learning methods and I assure you that if you are here with us, you are going to be the next generation leader who can understand the complexities of technology and society, to meet the never diverse challenges of new century.\nOne of the parameters for judging any academic institution is the research activities it is pursuing. From the day one of the establishment of this college we are committed to conducting research and development. At this point, I am proud to point out that we have different research cell in both the departments and research activities are being undertaken by the concerned faculties and students in the departments. We understand that the superiority of any academic institution lies on the performance of students. We highly believe our students and encourage them to take the advantage of all the supports available to them at Sagarmatha.\nEngineers, in addition to being technically and analytically sound, must complement their capabilities with understanding of “soft issues” that are non-technical. We try to enhance the soft skill of students so that they can be successful in all the spheres of life. We plan to provide extensive training to the students promote their soft skills so that they will be easily assimilated by job market.\nI feel privileged to state that many of our students have secured highest ranks in the final examination conducted by Institute of Engineering in the past and believe that new lot of students will continue the trait.
